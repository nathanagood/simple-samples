# Simple Samples

This project contains a few very simple sample projects in different languages. Over the years, 
I've had to document processes in various books, articles, and technical documentation and it
took far too long to come up with the idea of having simple examples always at the ready. I 
often have to create them from scratch every time I write something, which is time consuming
albeit educational.

## Java Web App

A simple Java web app, using Spring and built with Gradle, is located in the `java-webapp` folder.
